## Hydra

[Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) is an open-source Python
framework that simplifies the development of research and other complex
applications. The key feature is the ability to dynamically create a
hierarchical configuration by composition and override it through config files
and the command line. 

## DPR configuration
The `biencoder_train_cfg.yaml` file is the top-level configuration file used in the project.
